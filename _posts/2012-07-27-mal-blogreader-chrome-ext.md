Last week i was searching for a kind of feed reader optimized for viewing Malayalam articles so that i will not miss any updates from Malayalam blogs. When following a list of blogs, you know its a boring task to open each and every website and look for new posts daily. Even though email subscription is ok, i was looking for a better alternative like a browser plugin. Sadly i didn’t find any thing that satisfies my needs especially for the case of Malayalam blogs. So i thought of coding a blog reader extension for Google chrome myself. As i have some experience with JavaScript and web designing, creating an extension for Google’s chrome browser was not at all a difficult task.

The extension works by fetching RSS feeds of the blogs. The whole design aspects such as fonts, character encoding, everything is optimized for Malayalam language and also the interface language of the extension is also Malayalam. So i named it as **Malayalam Blog reader** and when i finished coding the initial functionalities of the blog reader i was about to publish my extension in chrome web store. But my bad luck, Google charges a one time developer fee of $5 from every developers and as i don’t have any credit cards for paying this amount, i was not able to publish my extension in chrome web store. Probably for me, the next option was Sourceforge as i already had published one of my work there ([JFSplit – A java based file splitter and joiner][jfsplit]). Sourceforge provides a nice web-based platform for hosting our software projects. So i hosted this project also in Sourceforge and the project homepage is [mal-blogreader.sourceforge.net][mal-blogreader]. You can download and install the extension from this website.
