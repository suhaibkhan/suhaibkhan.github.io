I was looking for a feed reader like application optimized for viewing Malayalam articles. When following a list of blogs, its not easy to open each and every website and look for updates. Even though email subscription is ok, i need a better alternative like a browser plugin. Sadly i didn’t find any thing that satisfies my needs, especially something optimized for Malayalam blogs. So i thought of making a blog reader extension for Google Chrome myself. As i have some experience with JavaScript and web designing, creating an extension for Chrome was not at all a difficult task.

The extension works by fetching RSS feeds of the blogs. The whole design aspects such as fonts, character encoding, everything is optimized for Malayalam language and also the interface language of the extension is also Malayalam. So i named it as **Malayalam Blog reader**. As i don't have any Google developer account, i was not able to publish the extension in Chrome Web Store. Probably for me, the next option was Sourceforge. I already published one of my work there ([JFSplit – A java based file splitter and joiner][jfsplit]). Sourceforge provides a nice web-based platform for hosting our software projects. So i hosted this project also in Sourceforge and the project homepage is [mal-blogreader.sourceforge.net][mal-blogreader]. You can download and install the extension from this website.
